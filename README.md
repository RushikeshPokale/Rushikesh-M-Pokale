# [Project 1 - Give Life Predict Blood Donations](https://github.com/RushikeshPokale/Give_Life-Predict_Blood_Donations)
  a. Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. According to WebMD, "about 5 million Americans need a blood transfusion every year".

                    **- Numpy**
                    **- Scikit Learn**
                    **- Tpot**
  d. Operations Performed:
                    - Used **Logistic Regression** as suggested to be best method By **TPOT library**
